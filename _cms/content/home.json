I used to work in the fashion industry, but a few years ago I decided to change direction and become a developer. \n\n![profile picture of Jedrzej Lewandowski](uploads/profile_bleeve_front_opt.jpg \"Profile Picture of Jedrzej Lewandowski\")\n\nCurrently, I am working full time as a front-end developer at Zoover B.V., a Dutch website that focuses on collecting and sharing reviews about holiday destinations. \n\nI love using the following technologies (not all necessarily in the same project :) :\n\n* Typescript\n* React\n* Angular\n* RxJS\n* GraphQL\n* Sass\n\nWhen I am not coding, I love to listen to tech and science podcasts, lose myself in an audiobook (mostly science fiction).\n\n*(Just FYI: I just started working on this version of the page, still in progress!)*"
