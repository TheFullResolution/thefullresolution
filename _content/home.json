  "description": "# About Me\n\nIn 2010, I left my hometown Gdynia, the seacoast of Poland, to find a new challenge. Currently, I am living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I used to work in the fashion industry, but a few years ago I decided to change direction and become a developer. \n\nCurrently, I am working full time as a front-end developer at Zoover B.V., a Dutch website that focuses on collecting and sharing reviews about holiday destinations. \n\nWhen I am not coding, I love to listen to tech and science podcasts, lose myself in an audiobook (mostly science fiction).\n\n_(Just FYI: I just started working on this version of the page, still in progress!)_"
